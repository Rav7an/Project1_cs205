### Implement blue glove detection and ROI cropping for MTM analysis

**Description:** Enhance the computer vision pipeline for MTM analysis by adding blue glove detection and region-of-interest (ROI) cropping before hand landmark detection. This preprocessing step is expected to:
- Improve hand detection accuracy with workers wearing blue gloves
- Increase effective hand resolution for downstream models (e.g., MediaPipe)
- Reduce background noise and speed up processing.

**Implementation details:**
- Use robust HSV-based color segmentation for blue glove detection
- Apply morphological operations to clean up the mask
- Extract bounding boxes of detected gloves and crop the frame accordingly
- Pass the cropped hand regions to the hand landmark detection module.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Demonstrate that hand detection accuracy is improved on sample videos
- Provide example code and usage instructions in the notebook.
